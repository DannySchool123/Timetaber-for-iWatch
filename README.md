### <i>Is it a typo? Is it a spelling error? NO! It's an Apple Watch Timetable App!</i>
Developed by me, Gill Palmer, the-trumpeter, this app is made to solve one of my biggest educational issues:
<b>forgetting my timetable.</b> If only I'm finished... Ah well, may be useless but there's still more to come!

#### Note on errors in repository
The code on GitHub is up to date at the cost of errors.
Since I'm not actively collaborating with anybody I commit all my changes after each session.
Sorry if the repository's code is erroring, you can probably guess that I don't know how to fix it.
