### Apple Watch Timetable App

Developed by me, Gill Palmer, the-trumpeter, this app is made to solve one of my biggest educational issues:
<b>forgetting my timetable.</b> If only I'm finished... Ah well, may be useless but there's still more to come!

### Looking for guidance
It's no secret to developers that you usually encounter a LOT of errors, and as a big amateur, most of those are pretty much beyond my understanding of Swift (especially whe people would indent with SPACES), and while I seem to have fixed them I am completely baffled as to what caused them, why they threw and how did I actually fix them.
Welcome if you read this, and please let me know if you are able to answer my questions!


#### Note on errors in repository
The code on GitHub is up to date at the cost of errors.
Since I'm not actively collaborating with anybody I commit all my changes after each session.
Sorry if the repository's code is erroring, you can probably guess that I don't know how to fix it.
